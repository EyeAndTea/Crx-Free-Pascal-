Part of my normalization work for free pascal. The code, and in particular that of crx.pas, should map back to the abstract language. Important parts include, feature detection, a normalized string, and the correct set of axioms for the normalization. Strictly, the normalization set is for FPC 2.6.4 and up. However, the normalization set goes back to FPC 1.9.3 where the code proves that any thing earlier can not be part of the Correct Form of the language.
